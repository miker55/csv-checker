                     Body="“Malformed quotes” errors happen when a CSV field’s quoting breaks standard CSV rules—most commonly
an unclosed quote, an unexpected quote character, or a line break inside a quoted value that the importer
can’t parse. Once quoting is off, column counts often appear wrong in subsequent rows." />

            <div class="mt-6 space-y-8">
                <CodeExample Title="1) Unclosed quote"
                             Code="id,comment
1,&quot;hello world
2,&quot;this is fine&quot;"
                             Explanation="Row 1 opens a quote but never closes it, so the parser may treat the rest of the file as part of that field." />

                <CodeExample Title="2) Quote inside a quoted value (needs escaping)"
                             Code="id,comment
1,&quot;She said &quot;hello&quot; to me&quot;
2,&quot;ok&quot;"
                             Explanation="If you need a quote character inside a quoted field, it usually must be escaped by doubling it (e.g., &quot;&quot;hello&quot;&quot;)." />

                <CodeExample Title="3) Line break inside a field (not properly quoted)"
                             Code="id,notes
1,first line
second line
2,ok"
                             Explanation="A raw newline splits the record into multiple rows. If you need line breaks inside a field, the field must be properly quoted." />

                <CodeExample Title="4) Smart quotes (non-standard quote characters)"
                             Code="id,comment
1,“hello world”
2,“ok”"
                             Explanation="Some exports replace normal quotes with “smart quotes”, which many importers don’t treat as valid CSV quoting." />

                Many importers stop at the first parse failure. CSV Checker scans the entire file and reports
                <strong>every row</strong> affected by malformed quoting, including the row/column location and related
                downstream issues (like unexpected column counts).
